# Collaborative CLDR locale generation

We aim to get Uralic languages to CLDR standard eventually. Please help us fill the tables here.

## Start working on new language

If it's written in Latin script, use copy Urj_Latn.markdown over to the language code. If it's in Cyrillic use the Urj_Cyrl.markdown template instead. The most important translations (and other features) are in the top. 

The following tables are already in the standard and can be used for reference:

* [Finnish](fi.html)
* [English](en.html)
* [Russian](ru.html)
* [Hungarian](hu.html)
* [Estonian](et.html)
* [North Sámi](se.html)
* ...

## Work-in-progress

* [Erzya](myv.html)
