<p>
  The <em>purpose</em> of the conference series International Workshop on
  Computational Linguistics for Uralic Languages is to bring together
  researchers working on computational approaches to working with these
  languages.  We accept long and short papers as well as tutorial proposals
  working on the following languages: Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Võro, the
  Sámi languages, Komi (Zyrian, Permyak), Mordvin (Erzya, Moksha), Mari (Hill,
  Meadow), Udmurt, Nenets (Tundra, Forest), Enets, Nganasan, Selkup, Mansi,
  Khanty, Veps, Karelian (Olonets), Karelian, Ingrian (Izhorian), Votic,
  Livonian, Ludic, and other related languages.
</p>

<p>
  All Uralic languages exhibit rich morphological structure, which makes
  processing them challenging for state-of-the-art computational linguistic
  approaches, the majority also suffer from a lack of resources and many are
  endangered.
</p>

<p>
  Research papers should be original, substantial and unpublished research, that
  can describe work-in-progress systems, frameworks, standards and evaluation
  schemes. Demos and tutorials will present systems and standards towards the
  goal of interoperability and unification of different projects, applications
  and research groups .  Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to):
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parsers, analysers and processing pipelines of Uralic languages</li>
  <li>Lexical databases, electronic dictionaries</li>
  <li>
    Finished end-user applications aimed at Uralic languages, such as
    spelling or grammar checkers, machine translation or speech processing
  </li>
  <li>Evaluation methods and gold standards, tagged corpora, treebanks</li>
  <li>
    Reports on language-independent or unsupervised methods as applied to
    Uralic languages
  </li>
  <li>
    Surveys and review articles on subjects related to computational
    linguistics for one or more Uralic languages
  </li>
  <li>
    Any work that aims at combining efforts and reducing duplication of
    work
  </li>
  <li>
    How to elicit activity from the language community, agitation campaigns,
    games with a purpose
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To maximise the possibility of reproducibility, replication and reuse, we
  particularly encourage submissions which present free/open-source language
  resources and make use of free/open-source software.
</p>

<p>
  One of the aims of this gathering is to avoid unnecessary duplicated work in
  field of Uralistics by establishing connections and interoperability
  standards between researchers and research groups working at different sites.
  We have also identified a serious lack of gold standards and evaluation
  metrics for all Uralic languages including those with national support, any
  work towards better resources in these fields will be greatly appreciated. To
  further these goals we propose to start discussions on forming an ACL special
  interest group (or similar) on Uralistics at the event.  In this year's
  edition we particularly encourage researchers of minority Uralic languages in
  Russia to participate.

  <li>3rd July 2016: Call for papers announced</li>
  <li>1st October 2016 2nd call for papers</li>
  <li>1st November 2016: Paper submission deadline</li>
  <li>1st December 2016: Paper notification</li>

  <li>23th–24rd January 2017: Workshop held in St. Petersburg</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submission of papers</h3>

<p>
<b>Language of submission:</b>
Submissions should be made in English or Russian with optional abstract(s) in
Uralic Language(s).
</p>

<p>
  <b>Submission format:</b> There are multiple submission types: long and short
  research papers, and demonstrations and tutorials. Research papers should be
  up to 18 pages in length excluding references, the descriptions for
  demonstrations and tutorials up to 5 pages. Submissions should be formatted
  using LaTeX default article style with b5paper option. Citations should be
  managed with bibtex and e.g., unsrt bibliography style. Linguistic glosses
  should follow Leipzig glossing rules and use expex LaTeX package (make sure
  to update expex regularly as it is developed actively). Preferred LaTeX
  version is XeLaTeX and therefore you should use UTF-8 encoded Unicode in your
  sources rather than TeX encoded characters where possible. You will find <a
   href="2017-iwclul-template.tar.xz">the workshop template here</a> (also in
 <a href="2017-iwclul-template.zip">zip format</a>).
</p>

<p>
  If you do not have access to  LaTeX text processign system, please contact us
  for alternative templates and instructions.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwclul2017">Submissions
   can be made here</a> using the EasyChair conference management system.
</p<

<p>
  <b>Publication venue:</b> Proceedings of the workshop will be published
  open-access in
  TBA
</p>

<p>
  <b>Conflicts of interest:</b> The reviewing process will be anonymous
  (double-blind peer review) and  authors should state in their submission all
  conflicts of interest with members of the programme committee. Members of the
  programme committee are also expected to state their conflicts of interest
  during review bidding.  If the programme committee finds themselves unable to
  review some of the submissions, external reviewers may be called.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Double submission:</b> To maximise the impact of work in the field of
  computational linguistics for the Uralic languages we are open to the
  possibility of double submission, or submission of work which has been
  partially published elsewhere. Any double submission should however be
  reported to the programme committee at the time of submission. In the advent
  of double acceptance the authors should choose in which venue to publish.
</p>
