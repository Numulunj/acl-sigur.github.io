## Call for papers


The *purpose* of the conference series International Workshop on Computational
Linguistics for Uralic Languages is to bring together researchers working on
computational approaches to working with these languages.  We accept long and
short papers as well as tutorial proposals working on the following languages:
Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Võro, the Sámi languages, Komi (Zyrian, Permyak),
Mordvin (Erzya, Moksha), Mari (Hill, Meadow), Udmurt, Nenets (Tundra, Forest),
Enets, Nganasan, Selkup, Mansi, Khanty, Veps, Karelian (Olonets), Karelian,
Ingrian (Izhorian), Votic, Livonian, Ludic, and other related languages.


All Uralic languages exhibit rich morphological structure, which makes
processing them challenging for state-of-the-art computational linguistic
approaches, the majority also suffer from a lack of resources and many are
endangered.

  Research papers should be original, substantial and unpublished research, that
can describe work-in-progress systems, frameworks, standards and evaluation
schemes. Demos and tutorials will present systems and standards towards the goal
of interoperability and unification of different projects, applications and
research groups   Appropriate topics include (but are not limited to):

* Parsers, analysers and processing pipelines of Uralic languages
* Lexical databases, electronic dictionaries
* Finished end-user applications aimed at Uralic languages, such as
  spelling or grammar checkers, machine translation or speech processing
* Evaluation methods and gold standards, tagged corpora, treebanks
* Reports on language-independent or unsupervised methods as applied to
  Uralic languages
* Surveys and review articles on subjects related to computational
  linguistics for one or more Uralic languages
* Any work that aims at combining efforts and reducing duplication of
  work
* How to elicit activity from the language community, agitation campaigns,
  games with a purpose

To maximise the possibility of reproducibility, replication and reuse, we
particularly encourage submissions which present free/open-source language
resources and make use of free/open-source software.

One of the aims of this gathering is to avoid unnecessary duplicated work in
field of Uralistics by establishing connections and interoperability standards
between researchers and research groups working at different sites.  We have
also identified a serious lack of gold standards and evaluation metrics for all
Uralic languages including those with national support, any work towards better
resources in these fields will be greatly appreciated. To further these goals we
propose to start discussions on forming an ACL special interest group (or
similar) on Uralistics at the event.  In this year's edition we particularly
encourage researchers of minority Uralic languages in Russia to participate.

### Important Dates

* 3rd July 2016: Call for papers announced
* 1st October 2016 2nd call for papers
* <del datetime="20161021Z1324">1st November</del><ins>7th November</ins> 2016: Paper submission deadline
* 1st December 2016: Paper notification
* 14th December 2016: Camera-ready deadline
* 23th January 2017: Workshop held in St. Petersburg


### Submission of papers

**Language of submission:** Submissions should be made in English or Russian
with optional abstract(s) in Uralic Language(s).


**Submission format:** There are multiple submission types: long and short
research papers, and demonstrations and tutorials. Research papers should be up
to 18 pages in length excluding references, the descriptions for demonstrations
and tutorials up to 5 pages. Submissions should be formatted using LaTeX default
article style with b5paper option. Citations should be managed with bibtex and
e.g., unsrt bibliography style. Linguistic glosses should follow Leipzig
glossing rules and use expex LaTeX package (make sure to update expex regularly
as it is developed actively). Preferred LaTeX version is XeLaTeX and therefore
you should use UTF-8 encoded Unicode in your sources rather than TeX encoded
characters where possible. You will find [the workshop template
here](http://gtweb.uit.no/iwclul2017/2017-iwclul-template.tar.xz) (also in [zip
format templates](http://gtweb.uit.no/iwclul2017/2017-iwclul-template.zip)).

If you do not have access to  LaTeX text processign system, please contact us
for alternative templates and instructions.

[Submissions can be made here][easychair-subs] using the EasyChair conference
management system.

**Publication venue:** Proceedings of the workshop will be published
  open-access in ACL anthology, SIG proceedings for SIGUR (new)

**Conflicts of interest:** The reviewing process will be anonymous
(double-blind peer review) and  authors should state in their submission all
conflicts of interest with members of the programme committee. Members of the
programme committee are also expected to state their conflicts of interest
during review bidding.  If the programme committee finds themselves unable to
review some of the submissions, external reviewers may be called.


**Double submission:** To maximise the impact of work in the field of
computational linguistics for the Uralic languages we are open to the
possibility of double submission, or submission of work which has been partially
published elsewhere. Any double submission should however be reported to the
programme committee at the time of submission. In the advent of double
acceptance the authors should choose in which venue to publish.

### Venue

The workshop will be held at The Norwegian University Centre in St. Petersburg


To register for the workshop please fill out [registration form][regform].
**NB:** there is an optional 50 euro fee for participation that will be used to
cover running costs.

### Travel


Participants from outside Russia area may require a visa to visit Russia. If
you require an invitation letter confirming your participation, please get in
contact with the local organising committee.

A small number of travel stipends will be available for authors of accepted
papers. After submitting your paper please contact the organising committee to
request consideration.

### Accommodation

Hotels maybe found through your preferred online hotel price comparison site.
If you have any questions about accommodation, please feel free to [contact the
